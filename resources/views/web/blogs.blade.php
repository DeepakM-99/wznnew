                            <p>&nbsp; Hey Harry, tell us a little about yourself and your daily routine. I am 28 years
                                old
                                and live in Canberra, where I was born and raised. Currently, I work in construction,
                                and am
                                fortunate to be a part of my family's business. The majority of my training is devoted
                                to
                                CrossFit, and I get the blood flowing on the weekends by skydiving and surfing.
                                Traveling
                                down the coast is something I love to do on weekends and making the most of my time. On
